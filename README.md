This is a small application developed to demonstrate implementation of Local Bound Service and Remote Bound Service (IPC two-way communication). From the LocalService (running in the same process) we are obtaining a random string. From the RemoteService (running in a different process), we are passing a string to the Service which processes it and returns it back to the client. This is a small  app written for teaching purpose. You are free to use/modify the code in anyway you like.
